  Writing concise code and designing systems that avoid unnecessary complexity.

- **Clarity** – fostering trust through transparent and readable code.  
  Prioritizing clean architecture, thorough documentation, and clear communication.

- **Performance** – optimizing for speed and resource efficiency.  
  Respecting both developer and user time by delivering fast, reliable results.
