Hello! I’m a data science enthusiast, a PhD in philosophy, and a lifelong learner who believes that technology should serve clarity, not complexity. I’m passionate about transforming complex data into clear, actionable insights that make a real difference.


## 🧭 From Philosophy to Python
I hold a PhD in Philosophy, with a specialization in the philosophy of science and the philosophy of nature.
This academic background has shaped my approach to problem-solving — grounded in rigorous thinking, logical structure, and a drive to uncover underlying patterns. These are the very skills that translate seamlessly into data analysis and artificial intelligence.

My studies taught me to ask meaningful questions, navigate complexity with curiosity, and prioritize clarity over jargon.
After several years of teaching and working as a web developer, I deepened my technical expertise — embracing Python programming, DevOps practices, and machine learning. Today, I combine humanistic insight with technical precision to build tools that are both intelligent and intuitive.

## ✨ My Philosophy
My approach to work and life is built on three core values:

– **Minimalism** — to remove noise, not meaning

– **Transparency** — to build trust, not to complicate

– **Speed** — to respect time: yours and mine

I believe that AI should simplify, not dominate — assist, not replace.

## 🧠 What I Do Now
I’ve completed the course **“Work in AI: Become a Data Scientist from Scratch”** and I’m currently taking part in the **GoToIT Masterclass**, where I learn under the guidance of mentors and support fellow learners.

At the same time, I design and develop my own projects at the crossroads of:

- **Data analysis** 
- **Machine learning** 
- **Software engineering** 
I focus on solving real-world problems with practical, data-driven solutions.

## 📁 About My Portfolio
This portfolio is where data meets design, and where **AI reveals what lies beneath the surface**.  
Here, you'll find a range of projects, including:

- Insightful **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on real-world datasets  
- Interactive **Streamlit applications** designed for seamless user experience  
- Smart **AI-powered tools** leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate meaningful insights  

I use technologies like **Python, SQL, scikit-learn, PyCaret, TensorFlow, and OpenAI** to transform complex data into clear, actionable insights — always focusing on usability, performance, and clarity.
