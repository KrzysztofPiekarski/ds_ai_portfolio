# Projects from the world of data, Python, and AI — built with clarity, simplicity, and speed.

## 📊🐍 Introduction
Welcome! Here I share projects in data analysis, machine learning, and AI — designed to solve real problems with elegant, practical solutions.


## 🎓🧠 Quick Story
My path started with a philosophy PhD, which sharpened my analytical thinking and problem-solving skills. After years in teaching and web development, I expanded my tech stack — from Python and automation to managing DevOps and Kubernetes.

Since 2019, I focus on data science and AI, combining precision and programming to build solutions that matter.

At the heart of my work are three core principles:

– **Minimalism** to clear noise, not meaning

– **Transparency** to build trust, not confusion

– **Speed** to respect your and my time

Whether tweaking language models, building apps, or analyzing data — I aim for clean code, clear interfaces, and solid results.

Technology is my tool; philosophy is my compass.


## 📘🤝 Current Activity
I’ve completed the **Work in AI: Become a Data Scientist from Scratch** course and am currently growing through the **GoToIT Masterclass** — all while passionately creating projects that merge data science, AI, and software engineering.
