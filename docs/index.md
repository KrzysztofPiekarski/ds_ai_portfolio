# Projects from the world of data, Python, and AI — built with clarity, simplicity, and speed.



## 📊🐍 Introduction
Welcome to my website showcasing projects in data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Here, I share my work that blends technical skills with a passion for solving real-world problems through data-driven approaches. 




## 🎓🧠 My Story


My journey into technology and data began with a solid philosophical education that taught me analytical thinking and how to solve complex problems. After years of experience as a teacher and web developer, I expanded my technical skills — from test automation and Python programming to managing DevOps environments and Kubernetes.

Since 2019, I have focused on data analysis and artificial intelligence, working on projects that combine precise thinking with practical programming skills. My mission is to build intelligent solutions that deliver real value.

My philosophy is simple:  
– **Minimalism** to remove noise, not meaning.  
– **Transparency** to build trust, not to complicate.  
– **Speed** to respect time — yours and mine.

I believe AI should simplify, not complicate.
Assist — not dominate.

Whether I’m fine-tuning a language model, designing an application, or analyzing data —
I prioritize clean code, clear interfaces, and concrete results.

Technology is my tool. Philosophy is my compass.




## 📘🤝 My current activity


I'm completing the course “Work in AI: Become a Data Scientist from Scratch” and I’m part of the GoToIT Masterclass program, where I grow under the guidance of mentors and support others on their learning path. At the same time, I design and implement my own projects at the intersection of data analysis, artificial intelligence, and software engineering — combining a passion for technology with a practical approach to solving real-world problems.





## 📈🎨 About portfolio


Welcome to my portfolio — where data meets design, and AI uncovers patterns beneath the surface.
Here, you’ll find a variety of projects, from insightful Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on real-world datasets to sleek, user-friendly Streamlit applications for interactive data exploration.

I also work on AI-driven solutions that reveal hidden patterns and bring data to life. My projects make use of Python, SQL, and key libraries like scikit-learn, PyCaret, and TensorFlow.

Each project is crafted with clarity and precision, focusing on usability, performance, and impact. My goal is to build intuitive tools that simplify complex data and make AI accessible.

I continuously update this portfolio with new ideas and innovations — I invite you to visit often!
